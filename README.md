# Coding with Open Data from Environmental Reporting BC

In this repo, we'll develop a collection of lessons based on the [data](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/soe/) and [code](https://github.com/bcgov) that Environmental Reporting BC has released.

### Content Guidelines:

  - **Skill focus**: each lesson should focus on helping learners gain a skill they'll need to work with the data and code released by BC, and enable learners to transfer those skills to other projects. 
  - **Lesson Format**: anything goes! But if you're looking for some guidance, consider:
   -  *Study group lesson*: a one hour hands-on tutorial, designed to be led by an instructor
   -  *Workshop lesson*: like the study group, but longer.
   -  *Self-study curriculum*: a tutorial designed to be followed by an independent learner.
  - **Content Format**: keep it as simple and dependency-free as possible. Markdown or plain text for text; IPython Notebooks or knitr scripts are good options, too!

### Contributing:

Please place your lesson in its own folder, and make sure everything needed (scripts, pointers to data or other code etc) are included and clearly labeled in your lesson folder.

Feel free to start brainstorming lesson ideas in the issue tracker before you begin!
