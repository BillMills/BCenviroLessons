### Grizzly Bear Population Units

First, you will need to get the data. Unfortunately, unlike the `.csv` files 
that we were able to read/download directly from DataBC. Visit the [metadata record](http://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/grizzly-bear-population-units/resource/7a7713f9-bcbd-46b8-968a-03d343d367fb) for the data at DataBC. Click on the 
**Go To Resource** button and submit the form with the following settings:

When you get the email with the link to the zip file, save it as `data/DataBC_GBPU.zip`

Unzip the file, and import the shapefile. You will need the `sp` and `rgdal` packages

```{r}

unzip("data/DataBC_GBPU.zip", exdir = "data")

gbpu <- readOGR(dsn = "data/GBPU_BC/", layer = "GBPU_BC_polygon", 
                encoding = "ESRI Shapefile")
```


```{r}
## getting the data
mortality <- read.csv("http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/soe/archive/data/plants-and-animals/2012_Grizzly_Status/Grizzly_bear_mortality_history.csv")

population <- read.csv("http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/soe/archive/data/plants-and-animals/2012_Grizzly_Status/Grizzly_population_estimate_2012.csv")


```


Now that we have the data, let's look at the top of it. 

```{r results='asis'}
kable(head(mortality))
```

We're going to use packages to organize and clean our data.

```{r results='asis'}


## let's get rid of unused columns
mortality <- mortality %>% 
  select(-contains("X."))


clean_mort <- mortality %>%
  separate(AGE_CLASS, into = c("minimum_age", "maximum_age"), sep = "-", extra = "merge") %>% 
  mutate(minimum_age = extract_numeric(minimum_age),
         maximum_age = extract_numeric(maximum_age))

kable(head(clean_mort))
```




## All columns should have the same data type
