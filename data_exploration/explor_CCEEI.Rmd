### Grizzly Bear Population Units

First, you will need to get the data. Unfortunately, unlike the `.csv` files 
that we were able to read/download directly from DataBC. Visit the [metadata record](http://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/grizzly-bear-population-units/resource/7a7713f9-bcbd-46b8-968a-03d343d367fb) for the data at DataBC. Click on the 
**Go To Resource** button and submit the form with the following settings:

When you get the email with the link to the zip file, save it as `data/DataBC_GBPU.zip`

Unzip the file, and import the shapefile. You will need the `sp` and `rgdal` packages

```{r}
library(sp)
library(rgdal)

unzip("data/DataBC_GBPU.zip", exdir = "data")

gbpu <- readOGR(dsn = "data/GBPU_BC/", layer = "GBPU_BC_polygon", 
                encoding = "ESRI Shapefile")
```
